Since hamburger is loose and you don’t have to cut it up into 
different sections (such as chicken and turkey), 
it is much easier to handle in large quantities and very versatile. 
I make master recipes of some things 
that can be used in many recipes.

Here are many ideas pertaining to hamburger, “master recipes” are on the left, 
“secondary recipes” are indented – you assemble these from the master recipes. 
You can also freeze the portion of the master recipe that is required in the 
secondary recipe and assemble the secondary recipe on the day you want to eat it. 
I do this a lot when trying and/or learning new recipes.
